-- Case Study Questions
-- This case study has LOTS of questions - they are broken up by area of focus including:

-- Pizza Metrics
-- Runner and Customer Experience
-- Ingredient Optimisation
-- Pricing and Ratings
-- Bonus DML Challenges (DML = Data Manipulation Language)
-- Each of the following case study questions can be answered using a single SQL statement.

-- Again, there are many questions in this case study - please feel free to pick and choose which ones youâ€™d like to try!

-- Before you start writing your SQL queries however - you might want to investigate the data, you may want to do something with some of those null values and data types in the customer_orders and runner_orders tables!

(SELECT CAST(duration AS FLOAT) AS duration
FROM runner_orders)
SELECT MAX(duration) - MIN(duration) AS difference

WITH cte AS
(SELECT DISTINCT(c.order_id), c.customer_id, r.runner_id, CAST(r.duration AS INTEGER), CAST(r.distance AS FLOAT)

SELECT order_id, runner_id, distance, duration, AVG(distance/duration)*60 AS km_per_hr
FROM cte

ORDER BY distance;
-- A noticeable trend is that runner 2 takes deliveries that are the furthest, but has the most inconsistent speeds,
-- having an average km/hr speed of from 35.1 to 93.6 for orders with the same distance.
-- Runners 1 and 3 have delivered for orders with the shortest distances, with much more consistency.


-- 7. What is the successful delivery percentage for each runner?
WITH cte AS
(SELECT runner_id, SUM(CASE WHEN cancellation IS NULL THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS successes, COUNT(order_id) AS orders

FROM cte2
JOIN pizza_names p ON p.pizza_id = cte2.pizza_id;
-- Standard ingredients for Meatlovers: Bacon, BBQ Sauce, Beef, Cheese, Chicken, Mushrooms, Pepperoni, and Salami
-- For Vegetarian: Cheese, Mushrooms, Onions, Peppers, Tomatoes, Tomato Sauce

-- 2. What was the most commonly added extra?
WITH cte AS
(SELECT pizza_id, CAST(s.topping AS INTEGER)
FROM customer_orders c, unnest(string_to_array(c.extras, ', ')) s(topping)
WHERE c.extras IS NOT NULL)
SELECT c.topping, COUNT(c.topping) AS times_ordered, p.topping_name
FROM cte c
JOIN pizza_toppings p ON p.topping_id = c.topping
GROUP BY c.topping, p.topping_name
ORDER BY times_ordered DESC;
-- The most commonly added extra was Bacon, ordered 4 times.

-- 3. What was the most common exclusion?
WITH cte AS
(SELECT pizza_id, CAST(s.topping AS INTEGER)
FROM customer_orders c, unnest(string_to_array(c.exclusions, ', ')) s(topping)
WHERE c.exclusions IS NOT NULL)
SELECT c.topping, COUNT(c.topping) AS times_excluded, p.topping_name
FROM cte c
JOIN pizza_toppings p ON p.topping_id = c.topping
GROUP BY c.topping, p.topping_name
ORDER BY times_excluded DESC;
-- The most common exclusion was Cheese, excluded 4 times.

-- 4. Generate an order item for each record in the customers_orders table in the format of one of the following:
-- 		Meat Lovers
-- 		Meat Lovers - Exclude Beef
-- 		Meat Lovers - Extra Bacon
-- 		Meat Lovers - Exclude Cheese, Bacon - Extra Mushroom, Peppers


-- 5. Generate an alphabetically ordered comma separated ingredient list for each pizza order from the customer_orders table and add a 2x in front of any relevant ingredients
-- 		For example: "Meat Lovers: 2xBacon, Beef, ... , Salami"


-- 6. What is the total quantity of each ingredient used in all delivered pizzas sorted by most frequent first?


-- Pricing and Ratings
-- 1. If a Meat Lovers pizza costs $12 and Vegetarian costs $10 and there were no charges for changes - how much money has Pizza Runner made so far if there are no delivery fees?
-- 2. What if there was an additional $1 charge for any pizza extras?
-- 		Add cheese is $1 extra
-- 3. What if substitutes were allowed at no additional cost but any additional extras were charged at $1?
-- 		Exclude Cheese and add Bacon is free
-- 		Exclude Cheese but add bacon and beef costs $1 extra
-- 4. What if meat substitutes and vegetable substitutes were allowed but any change outside were charged at $2 and $1 respectively?
-- 		Exclude Cheese and add Bacon is $2 extra
-- 		Exclude Beef and add mushroom is $1 extra
-- 		Exclude Beef and add Bacon is free
-- 		Exclude Beef and Mushroom, and add Bacon and Cheese is free
-- 5. The Pizza Runner team now wants to add an additional ratings system that allows customers to rate their runner, how would you design an additional table for this new dataset - generate a schema for this new table and insert your own data for ratings for each successful customer order between 1 to 5.
-- 6. Using your newly generated table - can you join all of the information together to form a table which has the following information for successful deliveries?
-- 		customer_id
-- 		order_id
-- 		runner_id
-- 		rating
-- 		order_time
-- 		pickup_time
-- 		Time between order and pickup
-- 		Delivery duration
-- 		Average speed
-- 		Total number of pizzas
-- 7. If a Meat Lovers pizza was $12 and Vegetarian $10 fixed prices with no cost for extras and each runner is paid $0.30 per kilometre traveled - how much money does Pizza Runner have left over after these deliveries?
-- 8. If 1 unit of each ingredient costs $0.50 - how much net revenue will Pizza Runner make if the costs from question 30 are used?

-- Bonus Questions
-- 1. If Danny wants to expand his range of pizzas - how would this impact the existing data design? Write an INSERT statement to demonstrate what would happen if a new Supreme pizza with all the toppings was added to the Pizza Runner menu?
-- 2. Danny notices a new existing data issue - the recipe for Meat Lovers pizzas was actually incorrect for the second week of January - there was actually a shortage of salami! Write an UPDATE statement to reflect this in the existing data
-- 3. Danny wants you to create 2 database views on top of the customer_orders and the runner_orders data tables to fix up all of the data issues
