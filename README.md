## #8weekSQLchallenge

The [8 Week SQL Challenge](https://8weeksqlchallenge.com/) by [Danny Ma](https://www.linkedin.com/in/datawithdanny/) is a fun, yet challenging series of challenges with one case study per week for 8 weeks. 

As an aspiring data scientist, I know that SQL is the first step to data wrangling and ETL that provides high quality data for machine learning. This is a skill that I wanted to improve on, which I've no doubt accomplished even with one case study under my belt. 

The following is a list of challenges that I've either completed or am currently working on:
1. Week 1 - Danny's Diner (Completed)
2. Week 2 - Pizza Runner (In-progress)
